I have never been satisfied with Github Pages and Jekyll for blogging in part because there is no good way to edit or change posts from iOS devices, or any devices without Git, for that matter. Instead of setting up some other server acting as a middleman between Dropbox and Github, I decide to make something using the Github API to retrieve and edit posts from my repository.
