## Installation

Run the following bash + curl command to install nix. Make sure *not* to run as root

`bash <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)`

Nix is a functional package manager for Unix systems designed to be completely reproducable with full package isolation.

Searching for a package:

`nix-env -qa '<package search term>'`

Installing a package:

`nix-env -i <package name>`

so in our case:

`nix-env -i rust`
