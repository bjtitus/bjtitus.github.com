In watching most of The Daily launch today, I couldn't help but notice the shift towards a more visual approach to news on the iPad. While the use of rich media and snazzy stats and information requires such presentation, I believe that this experience is not ideal for reading news. The reading experience is very important for a publication that is going to be read daily by millions of readers.
