# Understanding Large Codebases

From [360iDev](https://360idev.com) 2019

Find the sample "project" (GitHawk fork) [here](https://github.com/bjtitus/GitHawk).

## New

Some tips for starting out on a new project.

### Xcode

- Use the Symbol Navigator to navigate through a project
- Use the Call Hierarchy to understand flow through project
- Use ⌃⌘J to jump to a definition in a project

### LLDB

- Add breakpoint sounds to quickly identify issues
	- [Debugging with "sound"](https://twitter.com/0xced/status/900692839557992449?s=20)
	- [Custom Sounds](http://sound-of-silence.com/?article=20170306)

- Import LLDB commands/breakpoints from a file
```
command source ~/.lldb-scripts/sounds/breakpoints.txt
```

- Autocontinuing sound breakpoints tagged with a name

```
breakpoint set -n "-[UIViewController dealloc]" -C "platform shell afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Submarine.aiff" --auto-continue true -d -N audio
```

- Use common scripts across projects
- Facebook's [Chisel](https://github.com/facebook/chisel) commands and helpers

- `apropos` command to search commands and help text
- `log enable -f /tmp/log.txt lldb all` enable logging to a file
- `value.GetError().GetCString()` retrieve string from error in SBValue (using LLDB's Python APIs)
- 
### Instruments

- Use system `os_log` messages for debugging
- Create Custom Instruments for system APIs: [CommonInstruments repo](https://github.com/bjtitus/CommonInstruments)

### Old

What can you do to make the onboarding process easier for new developers?

### Xcode

- Documentation mini map
- Hold ⌘ to show symbols

### LLDB

- Add a file to contain breakpoints and other LLDB setup
- Create application specific commands: see the [GitHawk commands](https://github.com/bjtitus/GitHawk/blob/360/commands.py)
- Use named breakpoints to quickly enable and disable breakpoints

```
breakpoint set -n malloc -N memory
breakpoint set -n free -N memory
breakpoint disable memory
```

To re-enable:

```
breakpoint enable memory
```

### Instruments

- Add Logs, Signposts and Points of Interest to construct a big picture of your app
- Create custom instruments that focus on parts, whether large and small, so issues can be debugged visually
	- Instruments packages can be distributed throughout the team and packaged into a single Xcode project for easy development

#### Debugging
- Make sure message format matches
- Refer to Instruments [documentation online](http://help.apple.com/instruments/developer/mac/current/). (Help > Instruments Developer Help)
- Use the "Instrument Inspector" and its "Schemas" tab to discover provided columns

- Can add CI step to verify Instruments traces
	- Risky since the file format is closed source
	- [TraceUtility](https://github.com/Qusic/TraceUtility) tool uses the libraries Bundled in the app
